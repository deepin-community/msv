msv package for Debian
----------------------

The original tarball for the package msv was obtained exporting
a copy of the tag msv-2009.1 from the upstream SVN repository
(https://svn.java.net/svn/msv~svn) and then performing the
following actions to make it DFSG-compliant:

 * remove all the precompiled .zip and .jar files;
 * remove the whole generator/ subdirectory, that is
   non-free;
 * remove two documentation .vsd files, that are non-free.
